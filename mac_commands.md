System_profiler tool:
system_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep " Memory:" 
system_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep Cores: 
system_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep Processors:
or, if you want to go low-level, use sysctl:
sysctl hw.memsize sysctl hw.ncpu
btw, there are a bunch of other interesting things you can get from sysctl. 
Try:
sysctl -a | grep cpu
